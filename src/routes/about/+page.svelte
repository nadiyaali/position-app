            In City Green, you step into the shoes of a city planner on a mission to combat climate change
            and fight the urban heat island effect. Set in your own city, your goal is to strategically 
            plant trees to increase tree canopy cover and create green spaces to cool it down.

            <b>City Green</b> has been created to take the imput from citizens on how to make our cities
        greener and fight climate change. Players can view the Urban Heat Island(UHI) index for each Mesh Block in
        Melbourne City and plant trees in order to combat the heat. Seed Stops can be visited to collect seeds and magic grow
        which can make the tree canopy grow faster. "Start Game" locates the player and zooms in. 
        Player can now click on any block to view UHI index and double click to plant a tree</p>
